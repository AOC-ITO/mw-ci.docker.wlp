and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, 
elaborations, or other modifications <br>
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For

by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works 
thereof.<br>
<br>

perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works 
of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, 
have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise 
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent 
claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
the Work or a Contribution incorporated <br>

infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License 
for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is 
filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or 
without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
 (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative 
Works  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and  
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding  those 
notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative  Works; 
and<br>
<br>
 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute 
must  include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of  the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as  part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form 
or  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; 
or,  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and  
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of 
the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not 
modify the License. You may add your own attribution notices 
within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an 
addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such 
additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the 
License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or 
conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede 
or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product 
names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and 
customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing 
the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent <br>
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, 
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a result of this <br>
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
(including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work 
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other 
commercial damages or <br>
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

transformation or translation of a Source form, including 
but not <br>
limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, 
and <br>
conversions to other media types. <br>
<br>
"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source 
or Object <br>
form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
copyright <br>
notice that is included in or attached to the work (an

provided in the Appendix below). <br>
<br>
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source 
or Object <br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for 
which the <br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications <br>
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For 
the purposes <br>
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works 
that remain <br>
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the 
interfaces of, <br>
the Work and Derivative Works thereof. <br>
<br>
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including 
the original <br>
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to 
that Work or <br>
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted 
to Licensor <br>
for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an 
individual or <br>
Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the

writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution." <br>
<br>
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or 
Legal Entity on <br>
behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor 
and <br>

<br>
2. Grant of Copyright License. <br>
<br>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each 
Contributor <br>
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, <br>
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, 
prepare <br>
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
sublicense, and <br>
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or 
Object form. <br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. <br>
<br>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each 
Contributor <br>
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, <br>
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this 
section) patent <br>
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, 
import, and <br>
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies 
only to those <br>
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are 
necessarily <br>
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination 
of their <br>
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) 
was <br>
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any 
entity <br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) 
alleging that the <br>
Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct <br>
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses granted to <br>
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of 
the date such <br>
litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with 
respect to <br>
contributions by an individual employed by an institution 
or <br>
organization is limited to patent claims where the 
individual that is <br>
the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent 
claims <br>
licensed, and where the organization or institution has the 
right to <br>
grant such license under applicable grant and research 
funding <br>
agreements. No other express or implied licenses are 
granted. <br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. <br>

Derivative Works <br>
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and 
in Source or <br>
Object form, provided that You meet the following 
conditions: <br>
<br>
1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative Works a <br>
   copy of this License; and <br>
<br>
2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices stating <br>
   that You changed the files; and <br>
<br>
3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative 
Works that You <br>
   distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
attribution notices <br>
   from the Source form of the Work, excluding those 
notices that do not <br>
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and <br>

use or <br>
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to 
damages for loss <br>
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and <br>
all other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor has <br>
been advised of the possibility of such damages. <br>
<br>

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, 
You may <br>
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of 
support, warranty, <br>
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with <br>
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only <br>
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on 
behalf of any <br>
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
defend, and hold <br>
each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims <br>
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your 
accepting any such <br>
warranty or additional liability. <br>

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It 
also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to <br>
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public 
Licenses are <br>
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
software--to <br>
make sure the software is free for all its users. <br>
<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some <br>
specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free <br>
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. 
You can use <br>
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about 
whether this <br>
license or the ordinary General Public License is the 
better strategy to <br>
use in any particular case, based on the explanations 
below. <br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not <br>
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make 
sure that you <br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and 
charge for <br>
this service if you wish); that you receive source code or 
can get it if <br>
you want it; that you can change the software and use 
pieces of it in <br>
new free programs; and that you are informed that you can 
do these <br>
things. <br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid <br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these <br>
rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you <br>
if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify 
it. <br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or <br>
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
we gave you. <br>
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code. <br>
If you link other code with the library, you must provide 
complete <br>
object files to the recipients, so that they can relink 
them with the <br>
library after making changes to the library and recompiling 
it. And you <br>
must show them these terms so they know their rights. <br>
<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the <br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you 
legal <br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. <br>
<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is <br>
no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is 
modified by <br>
someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that 
what they <br>
have is not the original version, so that the original 
author's <br>
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be 
introduced by <br>
others. <br>
<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any <br>
free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot 
effectively <br>
restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a 
restrictive license <br>
from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent 
license <br>
obtained for a version of the library must be consistent 
with the full <br>
freedom of use specified in this license. <br>
<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary <br>
GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser 
General Public <br>
License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is 
quite different <br>
from the ordinary General Public License. We use this 
license for <br>
certain libraries in order to permit linking those 
libraries into <br>
non-free programs. <br>
<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a <br>
shared library, the combination of the two is legally 
speaking a <br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The 
ordinary <br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only 
if the entire <br>
combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser 
General Public <br>
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code 
with the <br>
library. <br>
<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does <br>
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary 
General Public <br>
License. It also provides other free software developers 
Less of an <br>
advantage over competing non-free programs. These 
disadvantages are the <br>
reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 
libraries. <br>
However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain 
special <br>
circumstances. <br>
<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to <br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it <br>
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be <br>
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a 
free library <br>
does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In 
this case, there <br>
is little to gain by limiting the free library to free 
software only, so <br>
we use the Lesser General Public License. <br>
<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free <br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large 
body of free <br>
software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library 
in non-free <br>
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU 
operating system, <br>
as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. <br>
<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the <br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program 
that is linked <br>
with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run 
that program <br>
using a modified version of the Library. <br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and <br>
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a <br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The <br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the 
latter must <br>
be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS FOR <br>
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION <br>
<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other <br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright 
holder or other <br>
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the 
terms of this <br>
Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). 
Each <br>
licensee is addressed as "you". <br>
<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data <br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs <br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables. <br>
<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which <br>
has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on 
the Library" <br>
means either the Library or any derivative work under 
copyright law: <br>
that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion 
of it, either <br>
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
straightforwardly into <br>
another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without <br>
limitation in the term "modification".) <br>
<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making <br>
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code 
means all the <br>
source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface <br>
definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
compilation and <br>
installation of the library. <br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not <br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The 
act of running <br>
a program using the Library is not restricted, and output 
from such a <br>
program is covered only if its contents constitute a work 
based on the <br>
Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool 
for writing <br>
it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does 
and what the <br>
program that uses the Library does. <br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete <br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that 
you <br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
appropriate <br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
all the notices <br>
that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
warranty; and <br>
distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. <br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and <br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of <br>
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and 
distribute <br>
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
above, provided <br>
that you also meet all of these conditions: <br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices <br>
       stating that you changed the files and the date of 
any change.<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed 
at no charge <br>
       to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a <br>
       table of data to be supplied by an application 
program that uses <br>
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility <br>
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure <br>
       that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function <br>
       or table, the facility still operates, and performs 
whatever part <br>
       of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
      (For example, a function in a library to compute 
square roots has <br>
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent 
of the <br>
      application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that 
any <br>
      application-supplied function or table used by this 
function must <br>
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, 
the square <br>
      root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If <br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library, and <br>
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works 
in <br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply 
to those <br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But 
when you <br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on <br>
the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the 
terms of this <br>
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire <br>
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who 
wrote it. <br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest <br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the 
intent is to <br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of 
derivative or <br>
collective works based on the Library. <br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library <br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a 
volume of a <br>
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 
work under the <br>
scope of this License. <br>
<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public <br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the 
Library. To do <br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this 
License, so that <br>
they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, 
version 2, <br>
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than 
version 2 of the <br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you 
can specify <br>
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other 
change in these <br>
notices. <br>
<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that <br>
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to 
all <br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. <br>
<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the <br>
Library into a program that is not a library. <br>
<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative <br>
of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the <br>
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany 
it with the <br>
complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which 
must be <br>
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium <br>
customarily used for software interchange. <br>
<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a <br>
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy 
the source <br>
code from the same place satisfies the requirement to 
distribute the <br>
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to 
copy the <br>
source along with the object code. <br>
<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, <br>
but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled 
or linked <br>
with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a 
work, in <br>
isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and 
therefore falls <br>
outside the scope of this License. <br>
<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates <br>
an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because 
it contains <br>
portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the 
library". <br>
The executable is therefore covered by this License. 
Section 6 states <br>
terms for distribution of such executables. <br>
<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file <br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work 
may be a <br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code 
is not. <br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work 
can be linked <br>
without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. 
The threshold <br>
for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. <br>
<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure <br>
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten <br>
lines or less in length), then the use of the object file 
is <br>
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. <br>
(Executables containing this object code plus portions of 
the Library <br>
will still fall under Section 6.) <br>
<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may <br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. <br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether <br>
or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. <br>
<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a <br>
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a 
work <br>
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that 
work under terms <br>
of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification 
of the work <br>
for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for 
debugging such <br>
modifications. <br>
<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the <br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
covered by <br>
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If 
the work during <br>
execution displays copyright notices, you must include the 
copyright <br>
notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
directing the <br>
user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of 
these things: <br>
<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding <br>
       machine-readable source code for the Library 
including whatever <br>
       changes were used in the work (which must be 
distributed under <br>
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
executable linked <br>
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable 
"work that <br>
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source 
code, so that the <br>
       user can modify the Library and then relink to 
produce a modified <br>
       executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood <br>
       that the user who changes the contents of 
definitions files in <br>
       the Library will not necessarily be able to 
recompile the <br>
       application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking 
with the <br>
       Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses 
at run time a <br>
       copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer <br>
       system, rather than copying library functions into 
the <br>
       executable, and (2) will operate properly with a 
modified version <br>
       of the library, if the user installs one, as long as 
the modified <br>
       version is interface-compatible with the version 
that the work <br>
       was made with.<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for 
at least three <br>
       years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in <br>
       Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the 
cost of <br>
       performing this distribution.<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering 
access to copy <br>
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the <br>
       above specified materials from the same place.<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these <br>
       materials or that you have already sent this user a 
copy.<br>
<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" <br>
must include any data and utility programs needed for 
reproducing the <br>
executable from it. However, as a special exception, the 
materials to be <br>
distributed need not include anything that is normally 
distributed (in <br>
either source or binary form) with the major components 
(compiler, <br>
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the 
executable runs, <br>
unless that component itself accompanies the executable. <br>
<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions <br>
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the <br>
operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use 
both them <br>
and the Library together in an executable that you 
distribute. <br>
<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library <br>
side-by-side in a single library together with other 
library facilities <br>
not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined 
library, <br>
provided that the separate distribution of the work based 
on the Library <br>
and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, 
and provided <br>
that you do these two things: <br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the 
same work based <br>
       on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. <br>
       This must be distributed under the terms of the 
Sections above.<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of 
the fact that <br>
       part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where <br>
       to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the <br>
Library except as expressly provided under this License. 
Any attempt <br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the <br>
Library is void, and will automatically terminate your 
rights under this <br>
License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you <br>
under this License will not have their licenses terminated 
so long as <br>
such parties remain in full compliance. <br>
<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not <br>
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to 
modify or <br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These 
actions are <br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
Therefore, by <br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on 
the <br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all <br>
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying the <br>
Library or works based on it. <br>
<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the <br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license 
from the <br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify 
the Library <br>
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose 
any further <br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
granted herein. <br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties with <br>
this License. <br>
<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent <br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent 
issues), <br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
agreement or <br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
they do not <br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you 
cannot distribute <br>
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and <br>
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not <br>
distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent 
license would <br>
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by 
all those who <br>
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the 
only way you <br>
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from <br>
distribution of the Library. <br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under <br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is 
intended to <br>
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in 
other <br>
circumstances. <br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any <br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any <br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the <br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is 
implemented <br>
by public license practices. Many people have made generous <br>
contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that <br>
system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to <br>
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute <br>
software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that <br>
choice. <br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be <br>
a consequence of the rest of this License. <br>
<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in <br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the <br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this 
License may <br>
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
excluding those <br>
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
among countries <br>
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates 
the <br>
limitation as if written in the body of this License. <br>
<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions <br>
of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. 
Such new <br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, 
but may <br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. <br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library <br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to 
it and "any <br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms 
and <br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version 
published by <br>
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not 
specify a license <br>
version number, you may choose any version ever published 
by the Free <br>
Software Foundation. <br>
<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free <br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible 
with these, <br>
write to the author to ask for permission. For software 
which is <br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the 
Free Software <br>
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our 
decision will be <br>
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives <br>
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse 
of software <br>
generally. <br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO <br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. <br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR <br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY 
OF ANY KIND, <br>
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
THE IMPLIED <br>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE. THE <br>
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
LIBRARY IS WITH <br>
YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE 
COST OF ALL <br>
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br>
<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN <br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
MAY MODIFY <br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
LIABLE TO YOU FOR <br>
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL <br>
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
LIBRARY <br>
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
RENDERED <br>
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF <br>
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF 
SUCH HOLDER OR <br>
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. <br>

software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other 
devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in 
the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
3.1. Availability of Source Code.<br>
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make 
available in Executable form must also be made available in Source 
Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only 
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this 
License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered 
Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform 
recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how 
they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a 
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software 
exchange.<br>
3.2. Modifications.<br>
The Modifications that You create or to which You 
contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent 
that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation
(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights 
conveyed by this License.<br>
3.3. Required Notices.<br>
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications 
that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You 
may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark 
notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of 
licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any 
Contributor or the Initial Developer.<br>
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.<br>
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered 
Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable 
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You 
may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more 
recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your 
own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any 
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, 
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and 
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered 
Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a 
license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this 
License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
License and that the license for the Executable form does not 
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code 
form from the rights set forth in this License. If You 
distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which 
differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the 
Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the 
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred 
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
any such terms You offer.<br>
3.6. Larger Works.<br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software 
with other code not governed by the terms of this License and 
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You 
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled 
for the Covered Software.<br>
4. Versions of the License.<br>
4.1. New Versions.<br>
Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish 
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each 
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as 
provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has 
the right to modify this License.<br>
4.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise 
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the 
version of the License under which You originally received the 
Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the 
Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise 
made available under any subsequent version of the License, You 
must distribute and make the Covered Software available under 
the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also 
choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software 
available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License 
published by the license steward.<br>
4.3. Modified Versions.<br>
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a 
new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use 
a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the 
license and remove any references to the name of the license 
steward (except to note that the license differs from this 
License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains 
terms which differ from this License.<br>
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS 
IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED 
SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL 
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY 
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
6. TERMINATION.<br>
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will 
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and 
fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the 
breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br>
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a 
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You 
assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that 
the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where 
the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where 
the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or 
indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted 
directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial 
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 
60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and 
automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if 
within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to 
the Participant Software against such Participant either 
unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.<br>
6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against 
Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or 
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as 
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses 
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be 
taken into account in determining the amount or value of any 
payment or license.<br>
6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 
above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You 
or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding 
licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive 
termination.<br>
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER 
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, 
THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY 
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH 
PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL 
DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY 
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term 
is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of 
“commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software 
documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire 
Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. 
Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, 
DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government 
rights in computer software under this License.<br>
9. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning 
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to 
be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the 
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be 
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice 
contained within the Original Software (except to the extent 
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such 
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located 
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained 
within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible 
for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and 
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 
is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides 
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the 
drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone 
are responsible for compliance with the United States export 
administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of 
any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make 
available any Covered Software.<br>
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each 
party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or 
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You 
agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of 
liability.<br>
<br>
NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND 
DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)<br>
The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the 
laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law 
provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to 
the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District 
of California and the state courts of the State of California, 
with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. <br>
