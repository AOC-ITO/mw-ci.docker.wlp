Red Hat End User License Agreement<br>
<br>
The Program includes some or all of the following licensed 
under the terms and conditions of the Red Hat End User License 
Agreement:<br>
<br>
Red Hat Universal Base Image<br>
<br>
END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT<br>
RED HAT UNIVERSAL BASE IMAGE<br>
<br>
PLEASE READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY 
BEFORE USING SOFTWARE FROM RED HAT. BY USING RED HAT SOFTWARE, YOU 
SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIS END USER LICENSE 
AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE TERMS. AN 
INDIVIDUAL ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS 
THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ON 
BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS 
AGREEMENT, THEN YOU MUST NOT USE THE RED HAT SOFTWARE. THIS END USER 
LICENSE AGREEMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY RIGHTS TO RED HAT SERVICES 
SUCH AS SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT. PLEASE REVIEW 
YOUR SERVICE OR SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT(S) THAT YOU MAY HAVE WITH 
RED HAT OR OTHER AUTHORIZED RED HAT SERVICE PROVIDERS REGARDING 
SERVICES AND ASSOCIATED PAYMENTS. <br>
<br>
This end user license agreement ("EULA") governs the use of 
Red Hat Universal Base Image and associated software supporting 
such container(s) and any related updates, source code, 
including the appearance, structure and organization (the 
"Programs"), regardless of the delivery mechanism. If a Red Hat 
Universal Base Image is included in another Red Hat product, the EULA 
terms of such other Red Hat product will apply and supersede this 
EULA. If a Red Hat Universal Base Image is included in a third 
party work, the terms of this EULA will continue to govern the 
Red Hat Universal Base Image. <br>
<br>
1. License Grant. Subject to the terms of this EULA, Red 
Hat, Inc. ("Red Hat") grants to you a perpetual, worldwide 
license to the Programs (each of which may include multiple 
software components). With the exception of the Red Hat trademark 
identified in Section 2 below, each software component is governed by 
a license that permits you to run, copy, modify, and 
redistribute (subject to certain obligations in some cases) the software 
components. This EULA pertains solely to the Programs and does not 
limit your rights under, or grant you rights that supersede, the 
license terms applicable to any particular component. The license 
terms applicable to each software component are provided in the 
source code of that component. <br>
<br>
2. Intellectual Property Rights. The Programs and each of 
their components are owned by Red Hat and other licensors and are 
protected under copyright law and other laws as applicable. Title to 
the Programs and any component shall remain with Red Hat and 
other licensors, subject to the applicable license, excluding any 
independently developed and licensed work. The "Red Hat" trademark is a 
registered trademark of Red Hat and its affiliates in the U.S. and 
other countries. Subject to Red Hat's trademark usage guidelines 
(set forth at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/), 
this EULA permits you to distribute the Programs that include 
the Red Hat trademark, provided you do not make any statements 
on behalf of Red Hat, including but not limited to, stating or 
in any way suggesting (in any public, private and/or 
confidential statement (whether written or verbal)) that Red Hat 
supports or endorses software built and delivered with a Red Hat 
Universal Base Image(s) (such derivative works referred to as a "Red 
Hat Based Container Images"); provided if a Red Hat Based 
Container Image is Red Hat Certified and deployed on a Red Hat 
supported configuration as set forth at https://access.redhat.
com/articles/2726611 then you may state that the Red Hat Universal Base Image is 
supported by Red Hat. You agree to include this unmodified EULA in 
all distributions of container images sourced, built or 
otherwise derived from the Programs. If you modify the Red Hat 
Universal Base Image(s), you must remove any Red Hat trademark(s) 
prior to any subsequent distribution. Any breach of this Section 
2 is a material breach of the EULA and you may no longer use 
and/or distribute the Red Hat trademark(s). Modifications to the 
software may corrupt the Programs. <br>
<br>
3. Limited Warranty. Except as specifically stated in this 
Section 3, a separate agreement with Red Hat, or a license for a 
particular component, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable 
law, the Programs and the components are provided and licensed 
"as is" without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, 
including the implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement 
or fitness for a particular purpose. Neither Red Hat nor its 
affiliates warrant that the functions contained in the Programs will 
meet your requirements or that the operation of the Programs 
will be entirely error free, appear or perform precisely as 
described in the accompanying documentation, or comply with 
regulatory requirements. Red Hat warrants that the media on which the 
Programs and the components are provided will be free from defects 
in materials and manufacture under normal use for a period of 
30 days from the date of delivery to you. This warranty 
extends only to the party that purchases subscription services for 
the supported configurations from Red Hat and/or its affiliates 
or a Red Hat authorized distributor. <br>
<br>
4. Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum 
extent permitted by applicable law, your exclusive remedy under 
this EULA is to return any defective media within 30 days of 
delivery along with a copy of your payment receipt and Red Hat, at 
its option, will replace it or refund the money you paid for 
the media. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable 
law, under no circumstances will Red Hat, its affiliates, any 
Red Hat authorized distributor, or the licensor of any 
component provided to you under this EULA be liable to you for any 
incidental or consequential damages, including lost profits or lost 
savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Programs or 
any component, even if Red Hat, its affiliates, an authorized 
distributor, and/or licensor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages. In no event shall Red Hat's or its affiliates' liability, 
an authorized distributor's liability or the liability of the 
licensor of a component provided to you under this EULA exceed the 
amount that you paid to Red Hat for the media under this EULA. <br>
<br>
5. Export Control. As required by the laws of the United 
States and other countries, you represent and warrant that you: 
(a) understand that the Programs and their components may be 
subject to export controls under the U.S. Commerce Department's 
Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"); (b) are not located in 
a prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. 
sanctions regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, 
Syria, and the Crimea Region of Ukraine, subject to change as 
posted by the United States government); (c) will not export, re-
export, or transfer the Programs to any prohibited destination, 
persons or entities on the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security 
Denied Parties List or Entity List, or the U.S. Office of Foreign 
Assets Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked 
Persons, or any similar lists maintained by other countries, without 
the necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s); (d) will 
not use or transfer the Programs for use in connection with any 
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, missile technology, or 
military end-uses where prohibited by an applicable arms embargo, 
unless authorized by the relevant government agency by regulation 
or specific license; (e) understand and agree that if you are 
in the United States and export or transfer the Programs to 
eligible end users, you will, to the extent required by EAR Section 
740.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to Red Hat Universal Base 
Image End User License Agreement Page 2 of 2 April, 2019 the 
Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which include 
the name and address (including country) of each transferee; 
and (f) understand that countries including the United States 
may restrict the import, use, or export of encryption products 
(which may include the Programs and the components) and agree that 
you shall be solely responsible for compliance with any such 
import, use, or export restrictions. <br>
<br>
6. Third Party Software. The Program may be provided with 
third party software programs subject to their own license terms. 
The license terms either accompany the third party software 
programs or, in some instances, may be viewed at registry.access.
redhat.com. If you do not agree to abide by the applicable license 
terms for the third party software programs, then you may not 
install, distribute or use them. <br>
<br>
7. General. If any provision of this EULA is held to be 
unenforceable, the enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be 
affected. Any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or relating 
to this EULA shall be governed by the laws of the State of New 
York and of the United States, without regard to any conflict of 
laws provisions. The rights and obligations of the parties to 
this EULA shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention 
on the International Sale of Goods. <br>

<br>
where such changes and/or additions to the Program 
originate from<br>
<br>

this Agreement<br>
<br>
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including 
Contributors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source 
Code or other<br>
<br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and 
for which the<br>
<br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications<br>
<br>
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or 
other form that<br>
<br>
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification 
of the<br>
<br>
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity 
any new file<br>
<br>
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the 
Program. Modified<br>
<br>
Works shall not include works that contain only 
declarations,<br>
<br>
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the 
Program solely<br>

the Program<br>
<br>
or Modified Works thereof.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making 
available<br>
<br>
in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for 
making<br>
<br>
modifications, including but not limited to software source 
code,<br>
<br>
documentation source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public 
License,<br>
<br>

including any<br>
<br>
exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the

<br>
Contributor.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor 
hereby<br>
<br>
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free 
copyright<br>
<br>
license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly 
display,<br>
<br>
publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the 
Contribution of such<br>
<br>
Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor 
hereby<br>
<br>
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free 
patent<br>
<br>
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to 
sell,<br>
<br>
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such 
Contributor,<br>
<br>
if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license 
shall<br>
<br>
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the 
Program if, at<br>
<br>
the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such 
addition<br>
<br>
of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered 
by the<br>
<br>
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any 
other<br>
<br>
combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware 
per se is<br>
<br>
licensed hereunder.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor 
grants the<br>
<br>
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no 
assurances are<br>
<br>
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not 
infringe the<br>
<br>
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other 
entity.<br>
<br>
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for 
claims<br>
<br>
brought by any other entity based on infringement of 
intellectual<br>
<br>
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising 
the<br>
<br>
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby<br>
<br>
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual<br>
<br>
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third 
party<br>
<br>
patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute 
the<br>
<br>
Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that 
license<br>
<br>
before distributing the Program.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has<br>
<br>
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to 
grant<br>
<br>
the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no<br>
<br>
Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other 
than<br>
<br>
those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such 
Recipient's<br>
<br>
receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary 
License<br>
<br>
(if permitted under the terms of Section 3).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, 
then:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, 
in<br>
<br>
accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must 
accompany<br>
<br>
the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the 
Program<br>
<br>
is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients 
how to<br>
<br>
obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium 
customarily<br>
<br>
used for software exchange; and<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a 
license<br>
<br>
different than this Agreement, provided that such license:<br>
<br>
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other 
Contributors all<br>
<br>
warranties and conditions, express and implied, including<br>
<br>
warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and<br>
<br>
implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and 
fitness<br>
<br>
for a particular purpose;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other 
Contributors all<br>
<br>
liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,<br>
<br>
incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' 
rights<br>
<br>
in the Source Code under section 3.2; and<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by 
any<br>
<br>
party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements<br>
<br>
of this section 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the<br>
<br>
Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate 
file or<br>
<br>
files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) 
the initial<br>
<br>
Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice 
described in<br>
<br>
Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made 
available<br>
<br>
under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy 
of<br>
<br>
the Program.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, 
patent,<br>
<br>
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or 
limitations<br>
<br>
of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from 
any copy of<br>
<br>
the Program which they Distribute, provided that 
Contributors may add<br>
<br>
their own appropriate notices.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
responsibilities<br>
<br>
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. 
While this<br>
<br>
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the 
Program,<br>
<br>
the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial 
product<br>
<br>
offering should do so in a manner which does not create 
potential<br>
<br>
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
Contributor includes<br>
<br>
the Program in a commercial product offering, such 
Contributor<br>
<br>
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and 
indemnify every<br>
<br>
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any 
losses,<br>
<br>
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from 
claims, lawsuits<br>
<br>
and other legal actions brought by a third party against 
the Indemnified<br>
<br>
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions 
of such<br>
<br>
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution 
of the Program<br>
<br>
in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this 
section do not<br>
<br>
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or 
alleged<br>
<br>
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an 
Indemnified<br>
<br>
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial 
Contributor in<br>
<br>
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial 
Contributor to control,<br>
<br>
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the 
defense and any<br>
<br>
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified 
Contributor may<br>
<br>
participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a 
commercial<br>
<br>
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a 
Commercial<br>
<br>
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes 
performance<br>
<br>
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those 
performance<br>
<br>
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's 
responsibility<br>
<br>
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would 
have to<br>
<br>
defend claims against the other Contributors related to 
those performance<br>
<br>
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other 
Contributor to<br>
<br>
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor 
must pay<br>
<br>
those damages.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
5. NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE 
EXTENT<br>
<br>
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN 
"AS IS"<br>
<br>
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESS OR<br>
<br>
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR 
CONDITIONS OF<br>
<br>
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR<br>
<br>
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
<br>
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and 
assumes all<br>
<br>
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this 
Agreement,<br>
<br>
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program 
errors,<br>
<br>
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, 
programs<br>
<br>
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of 
operations.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE 
EXTENT<br>
<br>
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY 
CONTRIBUTORS<br>
<br>
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,<br>
<br>
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT 
LIMITATION LOST<br>
<br>
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, 
WHETHER IN<br>
<br>
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE 
OR OTHERWISE)<br>
<br>
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE 
PROGRAM OR THE<br>
<br>
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED 
OF THE<br>
<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7. GENERAL<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or 
unenforceable under<br>
<br>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or 
enforceability of<br>
<br>
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without 
further<br>
<br>
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be 
reformed to the<br>
<br>
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and 
enforceable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity<br>
<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) 
alleging that the<br>
<br>
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with 
other software<br>
<br>
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then 
such Recipient's<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the 
date such<br>
<br>
litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate 
if it<br>
<br>
fails to comply with any of the material terms or 
conditions of this<br>
<br>
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable 
period of<br>
<br>
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all 
Recipient's<br>
<br>
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to 
cease use<br>
<br>
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably 
practicable.<br>
<br>
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and 
any licenses<br>
<br>
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue 
and survive.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this 
Agreement,<br>
<br>
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is 
copyrighted and<br>
<br>
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement 
Steward<br>
<br>
reserves the right to publish new versions (including 
revisions) of<br>
<br>
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the 
Agreement<br>
<br>
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse 
Foundation<br>
<br>
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation 
may assign the<br>
<br>
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a 
suitable separate<br>
<br>
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
distinguishing<br>
<br>
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may 
always be<br>
<br>
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under 
which it was<br>
<br>
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement 
is published,<br>
<br>
Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including 
its<br>
<br>
Contributions) under the new version.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, 
Recipient<br>
<br>
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property 
of any<br>
<br>
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by 
implication,<br>
<br>
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not 
expressly granted<br>
<br>
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this 
Agreement is intended<br>
<br>
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor 
or Recipient.<br>
<br>
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this 
Agreement.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
"This Source Code may also be made available under the

<br>
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such

is not sufficient to license the Source Code under 
Secondary Licenses.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source

<br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for 
which the<br>
<br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications<br>
<br>
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For 
the purposes<br>
<br>
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works 
that remain<br>
<br>
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the 
interfaces of,<br>
<br>
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>

copyright owner<br>
<br>

behalf of<br>
<br>
the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,

control systems,<br>
<br>
and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on

designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a 
Contribution."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or 
Legal Entity<br>

<br>
<br>
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
<br>
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
<br>
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
<br>
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
<br>
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute the<br>
<br>
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
<br>
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
<br>
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
<br>
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, 
have made,<br>
<br>
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer 
the Work,<br>
<br>
where such license applies only to those patent claims 
licensable<br>
<br>
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
<br>
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s)<br>
<br>
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. 
If You<br>
<br>
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
<br>
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the 
Work<br>
<br>
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes 
direct<br>
<br>
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses<br>
<br>
granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate<br>
<br>
as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the<br>
<br>
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or 
without<br>
<br>
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You<br>
<br>
meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
<br>
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices<br>
<br>
stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative 
Works<br>
<br>
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
<br>
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
<br>
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
<br>
the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
<br>
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute 
must<br>
<br>
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
<br>
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
<br>
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
<br>
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed<br>
<br>
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
<br>
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; 
or,<br>
<br>
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
<br>
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents<br>
<br>
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
<br>
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
<br>
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, 
alongside<br>
<br>
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
<br>
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
<br>
as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and<br>
<br>
may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions<br>
<br>
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or<br>
<br>
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
<br>
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with<br>
<br>
the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise,<br>
<br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work<br>
<br>
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of<br>
<br>
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede 
or modify<br>
<br>
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have 
executed<br>
<br>
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade<br>
<br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor,<br>
<br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the<br>
<br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or<br>
<br>
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
<br>
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
<br>
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or<br>
<br>
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or 
conditions<br>
<br>
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR 
A<br>
<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
<br>
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any<br>
<br>
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under 
this License.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory,<br>
<br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise,<br>
<br>
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly<br>
<br>
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
<br>
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, 
special,<br>
<br>
incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a<br>
<br>
result of this License or out of the use or inability to 
use the<br>
<br>
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of 
goodwill,<br>
<br>
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and 
all<br>
<br>
other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
<br>
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
<br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer,<br>
<br>
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity,<br>
<br>
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this<br>
<br>
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may 
act only<br>
<br>
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on 
behalf<br>
<br>
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
<br>
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
<br>
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor 
by reason<br>
<br>
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
