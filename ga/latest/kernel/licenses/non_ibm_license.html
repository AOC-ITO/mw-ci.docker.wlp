PREAMBLE<br>
<br>
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate 
worldwide<br>
development of collaborative font projects, to support the 
font creation<br>
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to 
provide a free and<br>
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in 
partnership<br>
with others.<br>
<br>
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, 
modified and<br>
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by 
themselves. The<br>
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, 
embedded,<br>
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that 
any reserved<br>
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and 
derivatives,<br>
however, cannot be released under any other type of 
license. The<br>
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not 
apply<br>
to any document created using the fonts or their 
derivatives.<br>
<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>

<br>
5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in 
whole,<br>
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must 
not be<br>
distributed under any other license. The requirement for 
fonts to<br>
