# Upgrading the image from Docker Hub to a production image

The WebSphere Liberty Docker containers found in Docker Hub contain an International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs (ILAN) license which allows entitled WebSphere Liberty customers to use these same containers under anÂ International Program License Agreement (IPLA) term.

All you have to do is set the environment variable called `LICENSE` to the value `accept`.  

However, if you wish to apply a license to the image, you can do so by:

*  Download the license JAR file from [Passport Advantage](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/pao_customer.html) / [Fix Central](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/).
*  Clone this repository.
*  Go to the `ga/production-upgrade` directory.
*  Place the downloaded Liberty license JAR file in the directory.
*  Review the `Dockerfile` and modify the filenames if required.
*  Build the image using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker build -t <image-name> .
    ```

The Dockerfile can also be modified and used to upgrade an image containing Liberty Core to Liberty Base / Liberty ND.
