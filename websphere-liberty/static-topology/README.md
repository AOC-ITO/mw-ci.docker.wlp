# Creating a static topology of Liberty servers under Docker

The files under this directory assist in the configuration of a static topology consisting of Docker containers running WebSphere Application Server Liberty with IBM HTTP Server and the WebSphere Plugin load balancing across them.

The [gen-plugin-cfg](gen-plugin-cfg) directory contains a script to embed into the containers that assist in the generation of the plugin-cfg.xml by using the MBean. The directory [get-plugin-cfg](get-plugin-cfg) contains a script that can be directed at a container that packages the first script in order to generate and retrieve the plugin-cfg.xml. This script also manipulates the hostname and ports specified in the file so that they reflect those external to the container rather than those used inside the container. The directory [merge-plugin-cfg](merge-plugin-cfg) contains a script that can be used to merge together multiple plugin-cfg.xml files into one file. The [test](test) directory contains a script for testing a combination of these scripts, and  also provides an example of their use.
